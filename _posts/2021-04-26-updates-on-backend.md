For the past couple of days I've been messing around with the static site-generator Jekyll based on Ruby which is what I've used to make this website. It's a pretty simple tool to use \[I do have experience with coding\] however I've been looking at workflows where people without a coding background can use this system.

To make this website I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) + [GitHub](https://github.com) Pages and the Jekyll theme A.P by kssim. Now I'll be adding [Forestry](http://forestry.io) to this workflow as my Content Management System or CMS. Now that takes care of my website structure, hosting and CMS. All I require now is to get a domain to host this which I've been procrastinating on for quite some time.
