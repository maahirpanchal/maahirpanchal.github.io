The internet, movies and television have skewed young minds into thinking that teens need to look super ripped and adults come with chiseled abs.
This is not always true. Being fit does not mean you show off your body, its just that you would love to.

Everyone has the ability to get into shape and stay there but it all comes down to you. YOU need to fuel your desire to get in shape.

I am going to lay down some simple keystone habits that will help you get yourself looking and feeling good. It is going to require your efforts - both Mind and Body.

We start off with laying down **a simple routine - a plan**. Consistently performing a set of simple exercises will show results in the long run. They would also keep you focused as you would know exactly what you need to do.

An example of a simple routine would be to Walk for 20 mins then performing 50 Mountain Climbers, 50 Squats and 50 Pushups. This might seem like a lot but these are rookie numbers. Split them into multiple sets. You can do 5 sets of 10 or 2 sets of 25, it is upto you.

The important thing is to stay focused and disciplined and perform this routine everyday. If you have to take a day off, do not make it two. Try to increase your reps in a given set then increase the total amount of reps.

Your sleep is a good part of getting into shape. This is where your muscles reconstruct. Muscles grow to lift more weights by tearing down and rebuilding themselves. Although it would depend on your own body, getting about 8-9 hours of sleep should be sufficient for most people.

Food is going to be key in your personal transformation. Most professionals would suggest counting calories and macros and they might be correct from their point of view.

 However, you are just getting started and so we are going to keep it simple. Fill up your plate on protien and the rest can be carbs. We are going to focus on whole foods for protien - Beans, Dairy, Chicken, Eggs, Lentils. Check your meals for excessive fats. Having a glass of milk a day can go a long way  [about 300ml would be 8-10g of protien, check the label]. Eggs are another source of good quality protien [about 6g, google nutrition facts for the kind of egg you are consuming]. I would recommend you do your own homework with regards to the food you can consume. Control your snacking. Eat filling meals but don't overeat too much. A banana roughly 15 mins before working out will help keep your energy levels right.  

Do not look at super ripped people in the movies, on tv shows or on the internet. There is a reason normal gym goers or people that consistently workout do not look like that. We are looking at a sustainable way to get into shape and maintain it.

In the long run, invest in some good jump rope and dumbells. These items have a sufficiently good ROI for you to spend your money on, if you use them.

Possibly stay away from supplementing with protien. If you are not in shape right now it is the fault of your eating habits and workout habits. We need to fix them before we try to boost them.

Consistency, Discipline and having a plan will go a long way in getting you fitter.
